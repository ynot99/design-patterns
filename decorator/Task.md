# Decorator

Task: Create a coffee ordering system where customers can order different types of coffees and customize them with different toppings. The system should be able to calculate the total cost of the coffee order, including the base cost of the coffee and the cost of added toppings.

You can implement the Decorator pattern to add toppings dynamically to the coffee object, without modifying the base Coffee class.
