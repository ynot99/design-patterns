# Singleton

Task: Implement a simple logger class using the Singleton design pattern.

Description: Your task is to create a Logger class that logs messages, and ensures that only one instance of the Logger class exists throughout the lifetime of the program using the Singleton design pattern.

The Logger class should have the following responsibilities:

- Log messages with a timestamp and a log level (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
- Keep a log history of all logged messages.
- Provide methods to retrieve the log history.

Instructions:

1. Implement the Logger class using the Singleton design pattern to ensure that only one instance of the Logger class can be created.
2. Add methods to the Logger class to log messages with a timestamp and a log level (e.g., log_info(message), log_warning(message), log_error(message)).
3. Maintain a log history of all logged messages, and provide methods to retrieve the log history (e.g., get_log_history()).
4. Test your implementation by logging messages with different log levels and retrieving the log history to verify that the Singleton design pattern is properly implemented.

This task will help you practice the Singleton design pattern, which ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the lifetime of a program, and provides a global point of access to that instance.
